[assurance]
# The common prefix of the assurance claims used in require.  This is prepended to every value that
# does not start with 'http[s]://' by itself already.
prefix = https://refeds.org/assurance

# This can be an arbitrarly complex boolean expression of claims that need to be
# satisfied. Supported operatiors are '&' (logical and), '|' logical or, as well as '(' and ')' for
# parenthesis. Each terminal is a string(-suffix), which might be contained in the users
# eduperson_assurance. Special terminals are: '+', which means "any claim". And '*' which is always
# satisfied.
#
# Some (REFEDS) examples:
# require = profile/espresso
#   -> Require that all users have the espresso profile
# require = *
#   -> Allow any user, regargdless of their assurance
# require = +
#   -> Allow any user, as long as they have some assurance claim
# require = APT/ePA-1m & profile/cappuccino
#  | APT/ePA-1m & IAP/medium & eppn-unique-no-reassign
#  | APT/ePA-1m & https://aai.egi.eu/loA#Substantial & ID/eppn-unique-no-reassign
