.. _configuration:

Configuration
=============

Two configuration files are required:

- ``motley_cue.conf``: contains configuration options relating to `authorisation`_.
- ``feudal_adapter.conf``: contains configuration options relating to the `account creation`_.


Configuration templates
-----------------------

Example config files explaining the options are included with ``motley_cue``. If you installed it via package manager, they will be located at ``/etc/motley_cue``.

- :ref:`motley_cue.conf <motley_cue_conf>`
- :ref:`feudal_adapter.conf <feudal_adapter_conf>`

.. warning::

    The default configuration might work well in most cases, but you have to configure the `authorisation`_ to enable any user to use your service.


Config files search paths
-------------------------

The config files will be searched in several places. Once one is found no further config files will be considered.

- **motley_cue.conf**

  - path configured via the environment variable ``MOTLEY_CUE_CONFIG``
  - ``./motley_cue.conf``
  - ``$HOME/.config/motley_cue/motley_cue.conf``
  - ``/etc/motley_cue/motley_cue.conf``

- **feudal_adapter.conf** (according to the `feudalAdapter documentation <https://git.scc.kit.edu/feudal/feudalAdapterLdf/-/tree/master#config-file-search-path>`_)

  - path configured via the environment variable ``FEUDAL_ADAPTER_CONFIG``
  - ``./feudal_adapter.conf``
  - ``$HOME/.config/feudal_adapter.conf``
  - ``$HOME/.config/feudal/feudal_adapter.conf``
  - ``/etc/feudal/feudal_adapter.conf``


.. _authorisation:

Authorisation configuration
---------------------------

You can configure who is allowed to use your service in ``motley_cue.conf``.

You can support multiple OPs and configure authorisation for each OP separately. There are three options to authorise users from the supported OPs:

- **authorise all**: allow all users from a trusted OP
- **individual**: authorise single users via their unique identifier given by the OIDC ``sub`` claim
- **VO-based**: authorise users that are members of a specific VO (or a set of VOs)


Below, a configuration block for one OP with default values. 

.. code-block:: ini

    [authorisation.<op shortname>]
    ## the complete URL for an OIDC provider. MANDATORY.
    ## this becomes the iss claim in an access token.
    op_url = <url>

    ## authorise all users from trusted OP, defaults to False if not specified
    authorise_all = False

    ## list of VOs whose users are authorised to use the service
    authorised_vos = []
    
    ## the OIDC claim containing the VOs specified above
    vo_claim = eduperson_entitlement
    
    ## how many VOs need to be matched from the list, valid options: all, one, or an int
    vo_match = one
    
    ## list of individual users authorised to use the service
    ## specified through OIDC 'sub', relative to the section's OP ('iss')
    authorised_users = []

    ## audience claim specific to this service (OPTIONAL); it can be a string or a list of strings
    ## if empty or not specified, audience checking will not be used for authorisation
    # audience = ssh_localhost

    ## list of authorised admins specified by OIDC 'sub'
    authorised_admins = []

- The section name has to start with ``authorisation.``
- The OP URL must be specified
- A VO must be specified as a string or an entitlement according to the AARC guideline `AARC-G002 <https://aarc-community.org/guidelines/aarc-g002>`_ (or `AARC-G069 <https://aarc-community.org/guidelines/aarc-g069>`_, once it is published)
- An individual user must be specified by its unique identifier at the OP (the ``sub`` claim)


Furthermore, you can also configure an **audience** for the service in order to restrict access to tokens that have been released for this specific audience (i.e., they contain the configured audience in the ``aud`` claim). The audience can be configured individually per-OP.

.. warning::

  Most OPs do not support requesting a specific audience for access tokens, in which case this setting is ignored. So far, only IAM allows requesting the audience.

.. _account creation:

Account creation configuration
-------------------------------

This is handled by the feudal adapter in ``feudal_adapter.conf`` (see the `documentation <https://git.scc.kit.edu/feudal/feudalAdapterLdf>`_ for details).

Pay close attention to the following configurations:

- **backend**: how are the users managed locally (e.g. local UNIX accounts, `LDAP <https://git.scc.kit.edu/feudal/feudalAdapterLdf/-/blob/master/LDAP.md>`_, ...)
- **assurance**: specifying minimum acceptable assurance (according to the `REFEDS Assurance Framework <https://refeds.org/assurance>`_)
- **username generator**: how local usernames are generated for users (e.g. trying to honour incoming ``preferred username`` from the OP, or using pooled accounts with a custom prefix)

An `approval workflow <https://git.scc.kit.edu/feudal/feudalAdapterLdf/-/tree/master#approval-workflow>`_ is supported as well, where local admins can approve or reject account creation requests. The notification system supported so far is email.

.. _additional_configurations:

Additional configurations
-------------------------

.. rubric:: One-time tokens

To enable SSH support for large access tokens (longer than 1k), you can enable the use of one-time tokens in the ``[mapper.otp]`` section in ``motley_cue.conf``.

Calling the ``/user/generate_otp`` endpoint will generate a shorter, one-time token and store it in a local, encrypted database. This token can then be used as an SSH password instead of the access token, and the ``/verify_user`` will be able to verify the username with this one-time token by retrieving the corresponding access token from the database.

You can also configure the location of the token database, the backend used, as well as the location of the encryption key.

.. code-block:: ini

  ############
  [mapper.otp]
  ############
  ## use one-time passwords (OTP) instead of tokens as ssh password -- default: False
  ## this can be used when access tokens are too long to be used as passwords (>1k)
  use_otp = True
  ##
  ## backend for storing the OTP-AT mapping -- default: sqlite
  ## supported backends: sqlite, sqlitedict
  # backend = sqlite
  ##
  ## location for storing token database -- default: /run/motley_cue/tokenmap.db
  # db_location = /run/motley_cue/tokenmap.db
  ## path to file containing key for encrypting token db -- default: /run/motley_cue/motley_cue.key
  ## key must be a URL-safe base64-encoded 32-byte key, and it will be created if it doesn't exist
  # keyfile = /run/motley_cue/motley_cue.key


.. rubric:: Swagger docs

By default, the Swagger documentation for the REST API is disabled. You can enable it in ``motley_cue.conf``, and change its location:

.. code-block:: ini

  ## enable swagger documentation -- default: False
  enable_docs = True
  ## location of swagger docs -- default: /docs
  docs_url = /api/v1/docs


If ``motley_cue`` is running on ``localhost``, these settings will enable the interactive Swagger docs at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs:
